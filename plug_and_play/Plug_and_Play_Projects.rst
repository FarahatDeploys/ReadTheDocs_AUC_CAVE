Plug and Play Projects 
+++++++++++++++++++++++++

The cave has some projects ready for visualization, you can run any of those projects directly without any edits or modifications, I made this page to guide you through every one of those projects!

.. Hint::
     Before triggering plug and play projects I do recommend **restarting** the PC to ensure memory is free! CAVE requires relatively huge memory consumption at least make sure we have 20GB of memory for your application.

Some projects require more memory compared to others, always monitor memory consumption

Projects
 - BASEBALLER Animation
 - HouseOnFlames
 - Double Lane Manuver
 - ChassisOnTheCAVE
 - EngineOnTheCAVE
 - ADAM_EGY_ANCIENT_CIVIL

 All these folder can be found in the following path 

 .. code:: 

   D:\PlugAndPlay

 Before Running this model i recommend you run CAVE_Unreal_Warping.bat tool, this tool simply calls our `warping.exe <http://warping.ee>`_ for each node.
**BASEBALLER Animation project shows**
 - Baseball animation for dynamics students
