Perception of Reality
  In CAVE VR, users are immersed in a virtual world, which, while vivid and interactive, is a digital simulation rather than the actual world.

Understanding
  CAVE VR users experience a digitally constructed reality, which can be designed to represent any environment, yet remains an artificial creation.

Transition to Truth
  Similarly, users stepping out of CAVE VR transition from a virtual environment back to the real world, potentially gaining new insights or perspectives based on their virtual experiences.
