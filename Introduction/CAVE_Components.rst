CAVE Components
===========================================
cave can be described as integration of different subsystems
- tracking system → responsible for tracking your movement inside the CAVE, Advanced Real Time systems supplied AUC with the tracking system
- projection system → projects the rendered graphics, could be made out of set of projectors or set of displays
- rendering system → responsible for carrying graphics calculation and handling the graphics pipeline usually made of Powerful workstation with high end graphics card.
  

Each one of those systems can work independently for example :
**you can run the projection system and rendering without tracking system, of course this won’t allow you to update the viewpoint or interact using the flystick.**
**you can run Tracking System with any Computer**
**you can run projection system with any powerful workstation.**
