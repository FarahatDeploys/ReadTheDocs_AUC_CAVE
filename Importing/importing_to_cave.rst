Importing your 3D Model to CAVE
==========================================
CAVE system will allow the user to visualize different 3D models, in the following pages you will find the different methods/pipelines we have found to immerse you inside the 3D model.

Up till now we support 3D models with following software applications only, lets call those applications **CAVE support Packages**

- Unreal Engine
- PARAVIEW
- Unity (Coming Soon)

   <div style="margin-bottom: 30px;"></div>

If you have 3D Model outside **CAVE support Package** you still can visualize it by making **CAVE support Package application as** intermediary software.

letâ€™s say you have a 3D model in a solidworks project, and you are willing to visualize it using CAVE system to do so you will have to transfer your model/animations into one of the support packages software (Unreal Engine, PARAVIEW or Unity) then you can visualize it directly using one of those software 

In the following pages i will be discussing how to integrate/export different 3D model extension from different visualization software into the CAVE:
