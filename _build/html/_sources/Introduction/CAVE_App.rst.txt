Introduction to CAVE (VR) System

Plato's Allegory of the Cave is a philosophical metaphor presented in his work "The Republic." It describes prisoners who have been chained inside a dark cave their entire lives, facing a blank wall. They can only see shadows cast by objects behind them, illuminated by a fire. These shadows constitute their reality, as they have never seen the actual objects or the outside world. One prisoner is freed and discovers the outside world, realizing that the shadows were mere reflections of true forms. Upon returning to the cave to enlighten the others, he is met with resistance and disbelief.

The CAVE VR (Cave Automatic Virtual Environment) system is a modern immersive virtual reality environment. It involves users standing inside a cube-like space where images are projected onto the walls, floor, and ceiling, creating a 3D immersive experience. Users often wear special glasses to enhance the 3D effect and interact with the virtual environment.
